'''Updating Tuples
Tuples are immutable which means you cannot update or change the values of
tuple elements. You are able to take portions of
existing tuples to create new tuples as the following example demonstrates âˆ’'''
tup1 = (12, 34.56);
tup2 = ('abc', 'xyz');

# Following action is not valid for tuples
# tup1[0] = 100;

# So let's create a new tuple as follows
tup3 = tup1 + tup2;
print (tup3);
'''Delete Tuple Elements
Removing individual tuple elements is not possible. There is, of course, nothing wrong
with putting together another tuple with
the undesired elements discarded.'''
